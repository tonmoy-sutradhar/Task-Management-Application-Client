### Short Description:

The Task Management Application is a collaborative tool that allows users to efficiently manage tasks through a drag-and-drop interface. Tasks are categorized into To-Do, In Progress, and Done, with real-time updates ensuring persistence. Users can add, edit, delete, and reorder tasks seamlessly.

Built with React (Vite.js) and Express.js, the app integrates Firebase Authentication for secure access and MongoDB for data storage. The UI is clean, minimalistic, and fully responsive for both desktop and mobile users. Additional features include dark mode, due date indicators, and an activity log.
